Since the site only has barebones functionality some routes are only accesible by
typing in the URL directly. (such as product)

There are still placeholder images in the site such as the carousel on the index and products pages
These will be generated and filled via serverside functionality which has not been implemented as of this upload

The search bar has some javascript integrated into it to imitate a search (search.js)
